			    <font size="4" face="lato"> Explanation: </b><br>
                2020 has been a chaotic year because a lot of tragic things happened in our world - and <br>one of it is the spread of COVID-19 viruses around the world.<br><br>

                Some of us loss something special that make us happy- it may be a person, a pet, <br>opportunity,  a specific event, and it is indeed losing hope thinking that it is already <br>gone. <br><br>

                We, the L.A.R.C.S Committee are spreading love and giving hope to all of us who are <br>affected by the pandemic. In a small act of kindness we can cheer them up and boost their <br>hope again. <br><br>

                Our design is a Bird made up of quadrilateral. Bird symbolizes hope and the unique <br>physical structure of birds with hollow bones, feathers, and light bodies gives them the <br>ability to fly through the open blue sky. When a bird open its wings to soar freely, <br>they let go of all their worries and fly above in the heavens and deliver divine <br>messages to the ones that need them the most. A bird is a reminder for us to keep flying <br>for our dream. All we need to do is slow down, pay attention, and observe the birds. <br>God can send these winged creatures to us with the very thing our hearts are crying <br>for. If we let them, they can be our best form of medication when we are in spiritual<br> pain and heartbroken.<br><br>
